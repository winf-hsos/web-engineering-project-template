# Web Engineering Project Template
A template you can clone for the web engineering projects at the University of Applied Sciences in Osnabrueck. It contains the most important folders properly named:

- `css` - The central place for all CSS files. The standard file `style.css` is already in there.
- `img` - The central place for all images.
- `includes` - Put all things in here that you want to load on every website. The best example is the navigation, for which there is already a template in the folders.
- `js` - All custom Javascript files go into this folder.
- `index.html` - The landing page of your webb app. Contains all references to Boostrap resources already, as well as the necessary code to include the `navigation.html` in the `/includes` folder.
